# Lung Cancer Prediction

This notebook demonstrates a basic machine learning pipeline for predicting lung cancer based on patient data.

## Steps Performed:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loaded the dataset (`lung cancer.csv`), performed initial data inspection, and visualized data distributions.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Checked for and removed duplicate rows and checked for missing values.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** Encoded categorical features ('GENDER' and 'LUNG_CANCER').
4.  **Model Training:** Split the data into training and testing sets and trained a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and ROC Curve/AUC Score.

## Results:

The model achieved an accuracy of 90
